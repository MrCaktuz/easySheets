# easySheets

* * *

EasySheets is a pathfinder character manager. It's a website that allow you to register multiple pathfinder characters sheets and manage them.
The idea of this first version is to give you the opportunity to manage you characters easily.
Have a clear & clean sheet to print and play with, but also a version full detailed to know where your stats are coming from.

## Dev Choices

- **Docker** as my dev environment setup inspired by [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-laravel-nginx-and-mysql-with-docker-compose). Never used Docker before but I wanted to for a moment now, this is it!
- **Laravel** as a CMS, yet the most customisable one I've use throw my projects, this will be needed.
- **VueJS** for the client, I've nerver worked with VueJs before, it's time to dive in.
